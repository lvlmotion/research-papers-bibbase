			<h2>Overview</h2>

			LEVEL is an assessment and exercise system designed to supplement rehabilitation professionals with real-time data on measurements and movement, collected by our sensors. LEVEL automates the information needed for charting, allowing clinicians more time to focus on patient diagnosis and treatment.

			LEVEL began as a research project at the University of Waterloo and Cardon Rehabilitation with the goal of creating a system for the rehabilitation industry, integrating together sensor data collection, pose estimation, and motion segmentation system with a strong focus in clinical development. LEVELâ€™s various components have been verified with rehabilitation data collected from several clinics in Ontario, alongside with feedback from patients and clinicians.
	
			Today, the goal of the LEVEL team is to build and commercialize the system. We want to create and support a robust and user-friendly system that both patient and clinicians can utilize as a tool which will strengthen clinical capabilities.
